# Utils

Keep your severs `light` and `fast` with `composables`.

`H3` is a `composable` framework. Instead of providing a big core, you start with a lightweight `app instance` and for every functionality, there is either a built-in utility or you can make yours.

`Benefits:`

- ✅ Your server only includes and runs the code that is needed
- ✅ You can extend your server functionality easily without adding global - - plugins
- ✅ The usage is explicit and clean with less global middleware and plugins
